<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, I’m Gowtham, a passionate aspiring Web Developer from Arakkonam, Tamil Nadu. I’ve recently graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from GRT Institute of Engineering & Technology, Thiruttani, but my true interest lies in web development, particularly as a Front-End Developer.</p>
  
  <p>During my academic journey, I developed a strong foundation in problem-solving and analytical thinking, skills that I now apply to web development. Though my background is in engineering, I discovered my passion for coding and web technologies through self-learning and personal projects. I’m committed to transforming creative ideas into functional, user-friendly websites.</p>  
  <h2>My technical skills include:</h2>
  
  <ul>
    <li>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript</li>
    <li>ReactJS, NodeJS</li>
    <li>Responsive Design (Mobile-first approach)</li>
    <li>Version Control with Git/GitHub</li>
</ul>
  <p>I’m driven by the challenge of turning complex requirements into simple, intuitive user experiences. My goal is to join an MNC as a Web Developer or Front-End Developer, where I can continue to learn, grow, and contribute to exciting projects.</p>
  <p>When I’m not coding, I love to explore new web technologies, follow the latest trends in UI/UX design, and constantly improve my skills.</p>
